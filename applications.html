		<li>Teas (<i>Tisanes</i>)</li>
			<p> 
				Tisanes are the result of liquid extracts of the herb's active components into water.
				The most commonly known method of creating a Tisane is by <b>infusion</b>: hot water extracts
				of the herb through short-term steeping, (e.g. chamomile or peppermint). Another method
				is creating a <b>decoction</b> which is a long-term boiled extract. This method isn't usually
				necessitated unless you are working with a less pourous and dense substance such
				as types of roots or bark. <b>Maceration</b> is a method that's only utilized for
				herbs that contain a high mucilage content, (a naturally occuring thick or glue-like substance
				secreted by the plant, e.g. sage or thyme). To curate a macerate, plants are chopped and
				soaked in cold water for 7-12 hours depending on the herb, then steeped in hot water for
				a desired amount of time for strength of the tea.

			<li>Tinctures</li> 
			<p> Tinctures are alcoholic extracts of herbs which tend to be much more potent
				than herbaceous teas. Tinctures are curated by combining 100% ethanol or a 1:1 ratio of 
				ethanol and water with the herb. A complete tincture can contain a range of 25-90% ethanol depending on the herb used.
				Tinctures may also be loosely referred to as "herbal wine" and "elixirs".			
			</p>
		
		<li>Extracts</li>
			<p> <b>Liquid Extracts</b>
			 Liquid extracts are liquids with a lower ethanol percentage than tinctures and typically made by vacuum distilling tinctures.
			</p>
			<p>	<b>Dry Extracts</b>
			Dry extracts are extracts of plant material that are evaporated into a dry mass. They can then be further refined to a capsule or tablet.
			</p>
			<p> **The exact composition of an herbal product is influenced by the method of extraction. 
				A tea will be rich in polar components because water is a polar solvent. 
				Oil on the other hand is a non-polar solvent and it will absorb non-polar compounds. Alcohol lies somewhere in between.
			</p>
			<p>	<b>Essential Oils</b>
				Extracts can be applied topically, usually diluted in a carrier oil. Many essential oils can burn the skin or are simply too high dose used straight; 
				diluting them in jojoba oil or another food grade oil such as almond oil can allow these to be used safely as a topical. Salves, oils, balms, creams and lotions are other 
				forms of topical delivery mechanisms. Most topical applications are oil extractions of herbs. Taking a food grade oil and soaking herbs in it for anywhere from weeks to months allows 
				certain phytochemicals to be extracted into the oil. This oil can then be made into salves, creams, lotions, or simply used as an oil for topical application. Many massage oils, antibacterial salves, 
				and wound healing compounds are made this way.
